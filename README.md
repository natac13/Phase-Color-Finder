A way to find the phase color of a 3-phase electrical system when you know the
circuit number.

3-phase electrical systems color code is - **Red, Black, Blue** respectively;
with odds and evens there own repeating group.

**Example**

*Therefore circuits numbered*
#1, #3, #5 = Red, Black, Blue;
#2, #4, #6 = Red, Black, Blue;
...
#67, #69, #71 = Red, Black, Blue;
#68, #70, #72 = Red, Black, Blue;
...
This will repeat indefinitely.
